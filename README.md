#### NTR Orthogonalization Library:
This library aids fMRI block-based studies in crafting word lists for their experiments. It focuses on ensuring that the constructed word lists have minimal correlation between words. The primary aim is to offer flexibility in determining the word list's length while preserving minimal inter-word correlation.

##### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Word List Construction**: Adjust the length of your word list based on your study's requirements.
- **Minimal Correlation**: Uses advanced algorithms to ensure that the words in the list have minimal correlation with each other.
- **Easy to Use**: Designed with scientists in mind, especially those with minimal coding experience.
- **Extensible**: Suitable for use in other related projects and adaptable for various datasets.

##### Getting Started:
1. Load your dataset or use the provided sample data.
2. Use the provided methods to filter, manipulate, and generate word lists.
3. Customize parameters as needed to suit your study's specific requirements.
4. Use the visualization tools to assess the quality of the generated word lists.

##### Customization:
The library is designed for flexibility. If you have your datasets or specific criteria, the library provides methods for customization. Detailed instructions on how to achieve this are available in the user guide.
