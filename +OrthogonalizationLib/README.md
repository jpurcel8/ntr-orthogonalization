# OrthogonalizationLib

This library provides functionalities for the NTR Orthogonalization process. It's designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy updates and modifications.

## Structure

- `NTR_Orthogonalization.m`: This is the main class that encapsulates the core logic of the NTR Orthogonalization process.
- `generateCorrelationData.m`: Contains functions related to generating correlation data from the word lists.
- `generateDistanceMatrices.m`: Handles the creation of distance matrices.
- `generateWordIndex.m`: Produces the word index of the final list.
- `visualizeDistanceMatrix.m`: Contains functions for visualizing distance matrices.

## How to Use

To use the library, add the `+OrthogonalizationLib` directory to your MATLAB path. You can then create an instance of the main class (`NTR_Orthogonalization`) and call its methods as required.

## Documentation

Each class and function within the library is documented with comments to provide context and explanations on their purpose and usage.
