# TODO

## Project Goals

1. Create a library to help fMRI block-based studies construct word lists for their experiments ensuring minimal correlation between words.
2. Ensure the library provides methods to adjust the word list's length while maintaining minimal correlation.
3. Allow ease of use for scientists with minimal coding experience.
4. Provide the capability for the library to be used for other related projects.

### Tasks

1. **Refactor Redundancies**: Eliminate duplicate methods and code fragments.
2. **Complete Placeholder Methods**: Fill in placeholder methods like `matchInputsToParameters` with proper implementations or detailed instructions.
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Update method comments to provide clarity on each function's purpose, inputs, and outputs.
4. **User Guide**: Develop a comprehensive user guide that explains how to use the library, including examples.
5. **Customization**: Ensure methods provide flexibility for users to incorporate their datasets and customize parameters.

## Getting Started with `ntr-orthogonalization` Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the desired directory.
   - Run: `git clone https://github.com/txrunn/ntr-orthogonalization.git`
   - This will create a folder named `ntr-orthogonalization` containing all the project files.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   - In the terminal or command prompt, navigate into the project: `cd ntr-orthogonalization`
   - All the MATLAB code, data files, and documentation are inside this directory.

3. **Setting Up MATLAB**:
   - Open MATLAB.
   - Set the current directory to the `ntr-orthogonalization` folder.
   - You can now access all the functions and scripts within the repository.

4. **Running the Main Script**:
   - In MATLAB, you can run the `main.m` script to execute the main functionality of the project. Ensure any required datasets are available.

5. **Exploring the Library**:
   - The `+OrthogonalizationLib` folder contains the main functions and methods used throughout the project. These are structured as MATLAB classes.

6. **Documentation and TODO**:
   - The `README.md` provides an overview and instructions for the project.
   - The `TODO.md` outlines tasks, goals, and steps to take for further development. Your team can use this as a guide to understand what needs to be done next.

7. **Making Changes**:
   - Always fetch the latest version of the code: `git fetch origin`
   - Pull the latest changes: `git pull`
   - After implementing changes or additions, add your files to the staging area: `git add .`
   - Commit your updates: `git commit -m "Your descriptive message about the changes"`
   - Push your updates to the repository: `git push origin master`
   - This ensures that all team members are working with the latest version.

8. **Reach Out for Help**:
   - Encourage your team to reach out if they encounter issues or have questions. Whether it's related to the project or GitHub, it's essential to maintain open communication.

   - Reach out to me @txrunn, if you need.
